### "Router metrics are metrics used by a router to make routing decisions. A metric is typically one of many fields in a routing table. Router metrics help the router choose the best route among multiple feasible routes to a destination. The route will go in the direction of the gateway with the lowest metric.  
### A router metric is typically based on information such as path length, bandwidth, load, hop count, path cost, delay, maximum transmission unit (MTU), reliability and communications cost.
## Examples  
### A metric can include: 

### measuring link utilization (using SNMP) 
### number of hops (hop count) 
### speed of the path 
### packet loss (router congestion/conditions) 
### Network delay 
### path reliability 
### path bandwidth 
### throughput [SNMP - query routers] 
### load 
### Maximum transmission unit (MTU) 
### administrator configured valueIn EIGRP, metrics is represented by an integer from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (The size of a 32-bit integer). In Microsoft Windows XP routing it ranges from 1 to 9999. 
### A metric can be considered as: 
### additive - the total cost of a path is the sum of the costs of individual links along the path, 
### concave - the total cost of a path is the minimum of the costs of individual links along the path, 
### multiplicative - the total cost of a path is the product of the costs of individual links along the path.
## Service level metrics  
### Router metrics are metrics used by a router to make routing decisions. It is typically one of many fields in a routing table. 
### Router metrics can contain any number of values that help the router determine the best route among multiple routes to a destination. A router metric typically based on information like path length, bandwidth, load, hop count, path cost, delay, MTU, reliability and communications cost.
